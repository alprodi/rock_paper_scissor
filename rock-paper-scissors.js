//Create function getComputerChoice which will randomly return 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors.'

//Put 'Rock', 'Paper', and 'Scissors' into an array
//Get a random number (between 0 and 1? If so, mult by 3).

//Temp Test: Print the result

//Create function that takes the playerSelection parameter (case-insensitive) and computerSelection parameter, 

//Return result via a string that declares the winner.


//After the above works:
//Write a new function called game(), calling the playRound function inside to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.
